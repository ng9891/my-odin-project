### Personal Notes
I had fun designing this project. I wanted it to be as close as it can get to an actual app so, I spent extra time on the CSS. Moreover, I followed the same module design pattern as the [TODO App](https://github.com/ng9891/my-odin-project/tree/main/js_fullstack/todo) I made.

P.S. Designing a loading animation with CSS Keyframes is very interesting. Should probably learn more.
