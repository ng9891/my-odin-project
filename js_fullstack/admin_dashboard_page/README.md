### Personal Notes
I had fun learning CSS Grid. Allowed me to make site layouts that I thought it was complicated to do before.

I made a `JS` file containing the list of projects I have completed during the course and generated the `cards` based on that list. I will be updating this list as I go.

Feel free to visit the site again to see my progress!

To review:
 - auto-fit / auto-fill
 - Grid template: auto 1fr
 - grid-area
 - grid-auto-flow
 - minmax()
 - clamp()
